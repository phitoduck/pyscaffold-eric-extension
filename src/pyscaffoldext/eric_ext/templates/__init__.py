"""
Template files to be added to the project.

The directory structure of this folder mirrors the directory structure
of the final project.

For example,

    templates/README.template.md                       replaces <project>/README.md
    templates/src/{{ package }}/__init__.template.py   replaces <project>/src/<package>/__init__.py

Note that the name ``{{ package }}`` is the *actual* name of the folder.
Files and folders with ``{{ some_opt }}`` as the name will be renamed to
the value of the ``some_ops`` key in the ``opts`` dict.
